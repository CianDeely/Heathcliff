# Heathcliff
Geosocial Networking Online Animal Rescue and Rehoming Mobile Application

A completed fully functioning Android application developed during my final year of my undergraduate degree. A modern mobile application that modernizes the animal adoption process. The project shows how a mobile application can reduce the strain on animal shelters by increasing visibility for animals
in shelters and by allowing remote viewing of animals by potential adopters.

The project showcases use of the following technologies: 
Android Mobile Operating System
Java Programming Language
RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)
Google Firebase Realtime Database
GPS (Global Positioning System)
Android Studio Integrated Development Environment

The project was a success and resulted in a 1st Class Honours grade for my degree in Software Engineering
